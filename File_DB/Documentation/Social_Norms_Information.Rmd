# 2. Method Clarification

## 2.1 Paper search and feeding papers database

The first step to implement this meta-analysis was to find paper. Thanks to different research portal, as Google Scholar, EconRepec, WebOfScience, Ideas and Google group ESA, we find 155 paper about cooperation and elicitation of social norms.
The selection criteria to identify papers in target was:

* **Game type**:
	+ Cooperation and prosociality games
	+ Presence of choice task and norm elicitation task
	+ Norms elicitation with Krupka and Weber (2013) or Bicchieri-Xiao (2009)
	+ Only monetary incentivized treatments (both choices and norms elicitation)

# 3. Homogeneity Criteria

For all games, we take into consideration the first round observation and the allocation where dictator have the maximum endowment and recipient have zero.

## 3.1 Dictator Game (DG)

We consider all DGs including at least two or more real players (no computers).

### Choice data:

* In case of repeated rounds, we consider only first-round decisions; if stranger matching protocol, and rounds differ in any of the design features (e.g., endowment, number of players, etc.) we can consider these as single independent observations
* To define cooperation levels, we look at final allocations; hence, for example, if dictators have some restrictions applying on their choices, such as donating only part of his endowment, we consider as cooperation the ratio between amount sent and total endowment
* No minigames (if minigames, these are flagged and possibly used in future analyses)

### Norm data: 

* If KW: norm (normative expectation) is computed by summing appropriateness scores of each actions and selecting the action with highest score; variance of norm is defined by computing the variance of appropriateness scores;
* If Bicchieri: average norm (normative expectation) is computed as average of subjects’ answers; we compute the variance of a norm by computing the variance of scores;
* If elicitation within subjects, only norm elicited from subjects playing role of Dictators; 
* If elicited actions are a subset of choice actions, then we considered the paper anyway

### Criteria for being defined as “Standard” (ref. Engel 2011) 

* Not a minigame
* Two players
* No papers that give the recipient any kind of power (and thereby bring the experiment close to an ultimatum game);
* No papers that mix the motive of benevolence with one of sanctioning the recipient
* No papers that limit the dictator’s action space such that it does not include the option to give nothing nor to take from the recipient
* No real effort task used to determine the dictator’s endowment

## 3.2 Take or Give Game (ToG)

This category includes DG with take framing.

* To define cooperation levels, we look at final allocations; hence, for example, if dictators have some restrictions applying on their choices, such as donating only part of his endowment, we consider as cooperation the ratio between amount sent and total endowment.

## 3.3 Public Good Game (PGG)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Maecenas porttitor congue massa. Fusce posuere, magna sed pulvinar ultricies, purus lectus malesuada libero, sit amet commodo magna eros quis urna.
Nunc viverra imperdiet enim. Fusce est. Vivamus a tellus.
Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Proin pharetra nonummy pede. Mauris et orci.
